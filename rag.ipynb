       "[Document(page_content=\"US. Citizenship Non-Precedent Decision of the\\n\\n \\n\\nand Immigration Administrative Appeals Office\\nServices\\nIn Re: 21169180 Date: SEP. 08, 2022\\n\\nAppeal of Vermont Service Center Decision\\n\\nForm I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (Extraordinary Ability — O)\\n\\nThe Petitioner, a skydiving center, seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as a skydiving\\ninstructor, coach, and videographer. To do so, the Petitioner seeks to classify the Beneficiary as an\\nO-1 nonimmigrant of extraordinary ability in athletics. This classification is available to individuals\\nwho can demonstrate their extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim\\nand whose achievements have been recognized in the field through extensive documentation. See\\nImmigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101(a)(15)(O)(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(O)Q).\\n\\nThe Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the record did not\\ncontain evidence of the Beneficiary’s receipt of a major, internationally recognized award, at least\\nthree of eight listed categories of documents, or comparable evidence of his eligibility. 8 C.F.R.\\n§ 214.2(0)(3)(iii)(A)-(C).\\n\\nIn these proceedings, it is the Petitioner’s burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit.\\nSection 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1361. Upon de novo review, we will dismiss the appeal.\\n\\nI. LAW\\n\\nAs relevant here, section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) of the Act establishes O-1 classification for an individual\\nwho has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics that has been\\ndemonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim, whose achievements have been\\nrecognized in the field through extensive documentation, and who seeks to enter the United States to\\ncontinue work in the area of extraordinary ability. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\\nregulations define “extraordinary ability in the field of science, education, business, or athletics” as “a\\nlevel of expertise indicating that the person is one of the small percentage who have arisen to the very\\ntop of the field of endeavor.” 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(ii).\\n\\nNext, DHS regulations set forth alternative evidentiary criteria for establishing a beneficiary’s\\nsustained acclaim and the recognition of achievements. A petitioner must submit evidence either of\\n“a major, internationally recognized award, suchas a Nobel Prize,” or of at least three of eight listed\\ncategories of documents. 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)@ii)(A)-(B). If the petitioner demonstrates that the\\n\\ni a\\n\\n \\n\\ni MON a a I a ig I\\n\\x0c\\nsubmit comparable evidence in order to establish the individual’s eligibility. 8 CFR.\\n§ 214.2(0)(3)Giii(C).\\n\\nThe submission of documents satisfying the initial evidentiary criteria does not, in and of itself,\\nestablish eligibility for O-1 classification. See 59 Fed. Reg. 41818, 41820 (Aug. 15, 1994) (“The\\nevidence submitted by the petitioner is not the standard for the classification, but merely the\\nmechanism to establish whether the standard has been met.”). Accordingly, where a petitioner\\nprovides qualifying evidence satisfying the initial evidentiary criteria, we will determine whether the\\ntotality of the record and the quality of the evidence shows sustained national or international acclaim\\nsuch that the individual is among the small percentage at the very top of the field of endeavor. See\\nsection 101(a)(15)(o)() of the Act and 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(ii), (iii). !\\n\\nIl. ANALYSIS\\n\\nThe Beneficiary indicates current employment as a skydiving instructor in Chile since 2019 and\\nprevious experience competing in the sport ir since 2016. The Petitioner seeks to employ\\nthe Beneficiary as a skydiving instructor, coach, and videographer for a period of approximately 43\\nmonths.? The Petitioner’s Working Agenda for 2021 to 2024 indicates the Beneficiary’s duties will\\ninclude coaching its skydiving students in multiple disciplines and competing in several national\\ntournaments.\\n\\nA. Eligibility Claims\\n\\nBecause the Petitioner did not establish that the Beneficiary has received a major, internationally\\nrecognized award, it must satisfy at least three of the alternate regulatory criteria at 8 C.F.R.\\n§ 214.2(0)(3)Gii)(B)(/)-(8). Within its initial submission, the Petitioner claimed that the Beneficiary\\nmet four of the cight regulatory criteria at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(iii)(B): awards at 8 C.F.R.\\n§ 214.2(0)(3)Gii)(B)(), memberships at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(iii)(B)(2), published material at\\n8C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)Gii)(B)(3), and employment in a critical or essential capacity at 8 C.F.R.\\n§ 214.2(0)(3)Gii)(B)\\\\(7). In response to the Director’s request for further evidence (RFE), the\\nPetitioner requested that the Director consider comparable evidence for one additional criterion,\\njudging at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(iii)(B)(4).\\n\\nThe Director subsequently denied the petition, determining that the Petitioner established that the\\nBeneficiary satisfied only one of the initial evidentiary criteria, awards under 8 C.F.R.\\n§ 214.2(0)(3)Gii)(B)()._ The record indicates that the Beneficiary placed third in the\\n\\ncategory at the 20 National Parachuting Championships. Accordingly, the Petitioner\\ndemonstrated that the Benéficiary satisfies this criterion, and we agree with the Director’s findings for\\nthis criterion.\\n\\n' See also Matter of Chawathe, 25 1&N Dec. 369,376 (AAO 2010), in which we held that, “truth is to be determined not\\nby the quantity of evidencealonebutby its quality.”\\n\\n? Pursuant to the regulations at 8 C.F.R. 214.2(0)(6)(iii), an approved petition for a noncitizen classified under section\\n101(a)(15)(O)(@) of the Act shall be valid for a period of time determined by the Director to be necessary to accomplish\\nthe event oractivity, not to exceed 3 years.\\n\\x0c\\nOn appeal, the Petitioner maintains the Beneficiary’ seligibility for four additional criteria. In addition,\\nfor the first time the Petitioner contends that the Beneficiary meets two further criteria, scholarly\\narticles at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(iii)(B)(6) and high salary at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(iii)(B)(8);\\nhowever, as the Petitioner did not make these claims before the Director, either at the time it filed the\\npetition or in response to the Director’s RFE, we will not consider these claims in our adjudication of\\nthis appeal. See Matter of Soriano, 19 I&N Dec. 764, 766 (BIA 1988) (providing that if “the petitioner\\nwas put on notice of the required evidence and given a reasonable opportunity to provide it for the\\nrecord before the denial, we will not consider evidence submitted on appeal for any purpose” and that\\n“we will adjudicate the appeal based on the record of proceedings” before the Chief); see also Matter\\nof Obaigbena, 19 I&N Dec 533 (BIA 1988).\\n\\nFor the reasons discussed below, the Petitioner did not establish that the Beneficiary meets the\\nrequirements of at least three criteria.\\n\\nB. Evidentiary Criteria\\n\\nDocumentation of the alien’s membership in associations in the field for which\\nclassification is sought, which require outstanding achievements of their members as\\njudged by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields.\\n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)Gii)(B)(2).\\n\\nThe Petitioner claimed that the Beneficiary satisfies this criterion based upon his membership in the\\n\\nParachute Association[_____] and the ____] Parachute FederationL____] his\\nskydiving qualifications, and his selection to participate in a Panam Sports Organization (PSO) High\\nPerformance Coaches Certificate | training course.\\n\\nFirst, regarding the Beneficiary’s memberships, the Petitioner provided the Beneficiary’sL__]\\nmembership card. In addition, it submitted several letters containing information relevant to this\\ncriterion. For instance, a “no objection” letter dated January 2021 fron. =i the\\n\\nin satisfaction of the consultation requirement at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(5)(ii)(A), also provides that the\\nBeneficiary is a member of the | An additional letter fromL___| provided two\\nwebsites which he asserts contain “criteria for membership and ratings,” but his letter does not mention\\nthe requirements for membership in the organization, nor did the Petitioner provide screenshots of the\\nwebsites supporting a claim that thel requires outstanding achievements of its members, as\\njudged by recognized national or international experts in the Beneficiary’s field or an allied one.\\n\\nFurther, letters from LT an qd representatives of thel__ | confirm the\\n\\nBeneficiary’s membership in that organization and include some of his competitive achievements in\\nthe sport A leter froml off the\\n\\nBeneficiary’s employer, mentions the Beneficiary’s “international experience in Championships and\\n\\ndifferent skydiveassociations or federations,” but does not specify in which associations or federations\\nthe Beneficiary has membership. An additional letter from provides that the\\nenefisiany is also a board member of but it does not assert that\\n\\nrequires outstanding achievements, as judged by recognized national\\nor international experts, to be appointed to its board.\\n\\x0c\\nmembership in associations in the field ror whicn Classification is sougnt, which require outstanding\\nachievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or international experts in their\\ndisciplines or fields.” Thus, the burden remains with the Petitioner to not only establish the\\nBeneficiary’s membership but to also demonstrate that those memberships require outstanding\\nachievements, as judged by recognized national or international experts in the field__Here, although\\nthe evidence presented confirms the Beneficiary’s membership inL___] and and board\\nmembership in the Petitioner did not point out which, if any,\\nevidence displays the membership requirements and explain how membership in those organizations\\nrequires outstanding achievements and reflects that judging is comprised of recognized national or\\ninternational experts.\\n\\n \\n\\nNext, pertaining to the Beneficiary’s skydiving qualifications, the Petitioner provided documentation\\nregarding his certifications, ratings, and endorsements, including 2017 Coach Rating Course\\ncompletion certificate; 2019 Skydiving Association parachutist Instructor D and AFF and\\nTA Endorsements; 202 || License D and coach certifications and AFF 1 and TAN | ratings;\\n2021L___ instructor rating certificate; and International Parachutist Certificate for\\nCertificate D and Packer B. However, he has not explainedhow achieving those certifications, ratings,\\nand endorsements conveyed membership in an association, as required by the plain language of the\\nregulation at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(iti)(B)(2).\\n\\n  \\n\\nMoreover, the Petitioner asserted that the Beneficiary’s selection to participate in a PSO High\\nPerformance Coaches Certificate | training course satisfies this criterion. It provided a letter dated\\nMarch 2021 from of the Chilean Skydiving Federation and\\nmember of the Chilean National Olympic Committee, who confirms the Beneficiary’s anticipated\\nparticipation in the training course, designed for “coaches, technicians and fitness trainers who work\\nin high-performance” who are “chosen by [the] National Olympic Committee of each country.” It\\nalso provided promotional material from PSO showing the training course was scheduled for March\\nto November 2021.3 However, the Petitioner cannot rely on those materials to establish the\\nBeneficiary’s eligibility at the time of filing this petition in April 2021. A petitioner must establish\\nthat all eligibility requirements for the immigration benefit have been satisfied from the time of the\\nfiling and continuing through adjudication. 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(1); see also Matter of Katigbak,\\n141I&N Dec. 45, 49 (Comm’r 1971). Regardless, the Petitioner has not explained how the\\nBeneficiary’s participation in the training course conveys membership in an association, as required\\nby the plain language of the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3 )(iii)(B)(2).\\n\\n \\n\\nThe documentation submitted further included general skydiving information, such as an excerpt from\\nthe 2019.

Soriano, 19 I&N Dec. at 766; see also Obaighena, 19 I&N\\nDec. at 533.\\n\\n    \\n\\n       \\n\\n  \\n\\nFinally, with respectto the Beneficiary’s third-place finish atthe 201 g___]National Parachuting\\nChampionships, the Petitioner emphasizes that in her letters, thls stated the\\nBeneficiary’s results were scored “by six L__}rated judges.” However, the Petitioner has not\\nexplained how the Beneficiary achieving third place in a national skydiving championship conveyed\\nmembership in an association, as required by the plain language of the regulation at 8 C.F.R.\\n§ 214.2(0)(3)(iii)(B)\\\\(2). The Petitioner submitted the same evidence in_ support of the awards\\ncriterion, which was appropriate given the nature of the [| National Parachuting\\nChampionships as a competition in the Beneficiary’s field rather than an association in his field.\\n\\nFor the reasons outlined above, the record does not reflect that the Petitioner submitted documentation\\nsufficient to demonstrate that the Beneficiary meets this criterion.\\n\\nPublished material in professional or major trade publications or major media about\\nthe alien, relating to the alien’s work in the field for which classification is sought,\\nwhich shall include the title, date, and author of such published material, and any\\nnecessary translation. 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(ili)(B)(3).\\n\\nThe Director determined that the record does not reflect that the Petitioner submitted sufficient\\ndocumentary evidence demonstrating that the Beneficiary meets this criterion.*\\n\\nThe Petitioner submitted articles dated between 2016 to 2021 pertaining to the Beneficiary from the\\nprint editions of the magazines|_____| Skydiver Magazine and Parachutist. We find that the\\nappearance of the Beneficiary’ snameand photograph in the 2019 issueof, LT Skydiver Magazine\\ndoes notrise to the level of an article about the Beneficiary. The magazine reported the individual and\\nteam results at the 20 ig National Parachuting Championships. While the article supports the\\n\\n4 The Director determined that the Petitioner did not satisfy this criterion, in part, because the articles submitted did not\\n“identify the beneficiary as a person who has risen to the very top of thefield of skydiving.” However, this consideration\\ndoes not relate to whether the Petitioner has met theplain language of this criterion. Ifthe Petitioner had satisfied at kast\\nthree criteria, which it did not, then we would have analyzed the published materials as part of the totality of the evidence\\nto determine if the Beneficiary’s successes are sufficient to establish that he has extraordinary ability in the field of\\nendeavor. Although we need not conduct such an analysis in this case, we briefly note that we do not find the record\\n\\neg ae a ee ll wt\\n\\n  \\n\\nwe\\n\\x0c\\nPetitioner’s claim of the Beneficiary’s bronze medal at this national event, the Beneficiary was not\\nidentified by name in a caption to the photograph, and the photograph appears to be one of many\\nphotographs of the competition’s individual and team winners. In addition, we note that while the\\nBeneficiary’s receipt of tandem coach, AFF, and tandem-instructor ratings, and A, C, and D licenses\\nhave been reported in the above-referenced magazines, mere mentions of the Beneficiary’s name in a\\nlist of rating, licensing, or tournament results cannot be considered articles about the Beneficiary.\\nArticles that are not about a noncitizen do not fulfill this regulatory criterion. Cf Negro-Plumpe v. Okin,\\n2:07-CV-820-ECR-RJJ at *1, *7 (D. Nev. Sept. 8, 2008) (upholding a finding that articles regarding a\\nshow are not about the actor).\\n\\nThe Petitioner also provided a screenshot dated September 2020 from the Facebook page of The\\nRating Center with a photograph of the Beneficiary at his employer, and\\nthe caption “Congratulations to United States Parachute Association\\nInstructor [the Beneficiary]!” Another screenshot from the Facebook page of the\\nParachute Federation dated 2016 contains the Beneficiary’s name anda photographof hima\\nThe Petitioner, however, did not provide supporting evidence indicating that those\\nFacebook pages or the print editions ofL___]Skydiver Magazine or Parachutist qualify as major\\ntrade publications or major media. Although the Petitioner submitted an email from the editor-\\npublisher ofL__] Skydiver Magazine, stating that the final print edition of\\nthe magazine in 2020 had an average circulation of 3000, the record does not contain evidence\\nshowing the circulation of Lo | skydiver Magazine relative to othel_____] media or trade\\nmagazines, to demonstrate the publication constitutes a major trade publication or major medium. In\\naddition, we note that none of the above-mentioned articles identify the author.\\n\\n   \\n \\n  \\n\\nMoreover, the Petitioner submitted a YouTube screenshot of a video posted | an\\norganization that provides skydiving experiences to cancer patients and survivors. The video reflected\\na two-minute interview of the Beneficiary in 2020. Although the Petitioner provided a transcription\\nof the video, it did not demonstrate published material about the Beneficiary relating to his work.\\nRather, transcription indicates that the Beneficiary was interviewed about skydive landings. The\\nPetitioner also did not establish the YouTube channel represents a major medium.\\n\\nFor the above reasons, the Petitioner has not established that the Beneficiary satisfies this criterion.\\n\\nEvidence of the alien’s participation ona panel, or individually, as a judge of the work\\nof others in the same or in an allied field of specialization to that for which\\nclassification is sought. 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(iii(B)(4).\\n\\nThe Petitioner did not initially claim cligibility for this criterion. Within its response to the Director's\\nRFE, the Petitioner argued that we should consider comparable evidence for this criterion. As\\nmentioned above, the regulation at 8 C.F.R. 214.2(0)(3)(iii)(C) provides that “Cijf the criteria in\\nparagraph (0)(3)(iii) of this section do not readily apply to the beneticiary’s occupation, the petitioner\\nmay submit comparable evidence in orderto establish the beneficiary’s cligibility.”5 Thus,a petitioner\\n\\n \\n\\n* Petitioners should submit evidence outlined in the evidentiary criteria if the criteria readily apply to the beneficiary’s\\noccupation. However, if the petitioner establishes that a particular criterion is not readily applicable to the beneticiary’s\\n\\x0c\\nmust demonstrate why the regulatory criterion does not pertain to a beneficiary’s occupation and how\\nthe evidence submitted is “comparable” to the objective evidence required at 8 C.F.R.\\n§ 214.2(0)(3)(iii).\\n\\nWithin its RFE response, the Petitioner contended that the Beneficiary worked as a judge “with other\\n\\nworld-renowned skydiving judges” in October 2016 when he “was invited to judge other skydiving\\nathletes alongside EL ane(————dat€ SS\\nSkydiving Championships.” The Petitioner submitted an email dated October 2016 that appears to be\\nfrom Co | addressed to the Beneficiary and others, referencing “the upcoming\\nChampionships” and ‘accommodation for the five ofus. .. for the Saturday night (12th November),”\\nand stating as follows:\\n\\n.... [believe registrations have been received for for 4 way, CF (not sure whether 2 or 4 way)\\nand accuracy. Will confirm the events during the week before the event.\\n\\nWe'll be using InTime so can you please bring a Windows based computer...\\n\\nLook forward to seeing you atl\\n\\nThe Petitioner also provided several pages from the 2008 | Parachute Federation| _|\\nJudges’ Handbook, screenshots from the website www. fai.org, and a screenshot that it claims is from\\nthe website asserting that these materials show the judging criteria, and that\\n\\nand are skydiving judges who are “exceptional in their fields.”\\n\\nAs noted by the Director, in order to meet this criterion, the Petitioner must show that the Beneficiary\\nhas not only been invited to judge the work of others, but also that he actually participated in the\\njudging of the work of others in the same or allied field of specialization. Here, the Petitioner has not\\npresented corroborating documentation showing that the Beneficiary actually participated in judging\\nskydiving athletes, and the events_at which the Beneficiary judged, to show that he actually\\nparticipated as a judge for the 2016 [State Skydiving Championships, as claimed.\\n\\nIn addition, the Petitioner has notasserted or established that Skydive coaches or instructors are unable\\nto participate on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied\\nfield. The fact that the Beneficiary did not participate in judging is not evidence that the criterion does\\nnotapply to his occupation. Further, the Petitioner did not demonstrate that the statements in the letter\\nof support from —i@d or the screenshots of judging criteria are equivalent to\\nparticipation on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied\\nfield. Accordingly, the Petitioner has not established that this criterion does not apply to the\\nBeneficiary’s occupation, nor has it shown that the documentation submitted reflects the same caliber\\nof experience as participating on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the\\nBeneficiary’s field.\\n\\noccupation, the petitioner may then use the compamble evidence provision to submit additional evidence that is not\\nspecifically described in that criterion but is comparable to that criterion. See 2 USCIS Policy Manual M.A(O),\\nhttps://www.uscis.gov/policy manual.\\n\\x0c\\nIll. CONCLUSION\\n\\nThe Petitioner has not submitted evidence that the Beneficiary has received a major, internationally\\nrecognized award pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3){ii1)(A). Further, although the Petitioner\\nestablished that the Beneficiary met the awards criterion at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(i1i)(B)(J), it did not\\nestablish that he meets the criteria relating to memberships in associations, published materials, and\\njudging. Although the Petitioner maintains the Beneficiary’s eligibility for an additional criterion on\\nappeal, relating to having been employed in a critical or essential capacity for distinguished\\norganizations and establishments at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3)(iii)(B)({7), we need notreach this additional\\nground. As the Petitioner cannot fulfill the initial evidentiary requirement of three criteria under\\n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(0)(3 \\\\iii)(B), we reserve this issue.6 Consequently, the Petitioner has not established\\nthe Beneficiary's eligibility for the O-1 visa classification as an individual of extraordinary ability in\\nathletics. The appeal will be dismissed for the above stated reasons, with each considered as an\\nindependent and alternate basis for the decision.\\n\\nORDER: The appeal is dismissed.\\n\\n6 See INS v. Bagumasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25-26 (1976) (stating that, like courts, federal a gencies are not generally required\\nto make findings and decisions unnecessary to the results they reach); see also Matter of L-A-C-, 26 1&N Dec. 516, 1.7\\n(declining to reach alternative issues on appeal where an applicant is otherwise ineligible).\\n\\x0c\\n\", metadata={'source': 'extracted_text.txt'})]"

You used to need a painter for a few months to paint a thing and now it's going to be speak to your phone to get your video. So Hollywood will start using it to generate scenes, which completely opens up. Yeah, so you can make a movie like Avatar eventually for under a million dollars. Much less.

And yeah, in some sense, that's kind of like currently what it looks like in terms of the development.
